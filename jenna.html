        <h1>Jenna the Cute and Cuddly, Fierce and Feisty Shih Tzu</h1>
        <p>To know me is to know that my dog, Jenna, actually Jennafur (get it?) is my best friend ever. Jenna is a 10 lb Imperial Shih Tzu, very sweet and VERY sassy. 
            She is the boss of our home and is not shy about letting her humans know what she likes and doesn’t like. She devours and demands bananas, goes wild for blueberries and will never say no to a piece of chicken. 
            She has her favorite spots to rest and relax, usually on one of our shoulders, like a bird. Oh and she’ll give you the look…and you know what’s coming next: 
            the teeth (!) if you make the poor choice to pet her in a way she isn’t extremely fond of. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Jenna loves car rides and rides in her stroller. Yes, you can often find me strolling in my neighborhood with my little pup in a doggie stroller. Most people enjoy stopping to chat or
             waving at us when we’re out and about. Last winter, I decided it would be fun to stay in a hotel downtown NYC with Jenna. Jenna loved strolling up and down Mulberry Street in Little 
             Italy and really enjoyed all the street vendors on Canal Street in Chinatown saying hello to her! Sitting and people watching in Columbus Park also was a fun adventure for Jenna. 

        </p>
        <p class="final">
            Living in a private house, she was so intrigued with the view of the city from our 10th floor hotel room. Seeing her watching all the sights below was priceless! 
            Another one of Jenna’s fave foods is apples and she definitely also loves the Big Apple, too!
