                        <p> When one of my closest and oldest friends told me she’d be living out of a van and traveling
                            for 3 weeks up and down the coast of Western Australia,
                            I told her she’s crazy! Won’t that be unsafe? She, on a whim, decided to go “downunder” and
                            sleep, eat and travel alone in a rented van. As you know,
                            I love a travel adventure, but I also love swiping my room key to my comfy hotel bed!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My friend updated me multiple times per day. It’s a 13 hour time difference between
                            Australia and NY so that was kind of odd for us. Her adventure began in Jurien Bay
                            which is about 2 hours north of Perth. Not only are the beaches absolutely beautiful but the
                            sea lions soaking up the sun all along the beach seemed to agree! I was
                            shocked when she FaceTimed me while she was on a fishing trip and then again when she was
                            pan frying her freshly caught dinner outside of her van at a remote campsite.
                            And what a sight of her surfing the giant sand dunes, swimming and snorkeling in the
                            beautiful Indian Ocean.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Only a few hours up north is a destination of a lifetime in Hutt Lagoon. I plan to visit
                            Australia if only to see this breathtaking, otherworldly lagoon.
                            The intensity of the colors including pink, magenta, mauve and blue are simply mystical!
                        </p>
                        <p class="final">
                            The rest of her days, and mine by proxy, were filled with countless beauty. The shark and
                            sea turtle tours in Exmouth to the whale watching in Rottnest Island, and all the kangaroos
                            and koalas in between made for an unforgettable Aussie adventure for my friend!
